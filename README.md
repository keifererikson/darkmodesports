`// Null spoilers. All suspense.`

Tired of spoiler exceptions crashing your day? DarkModeSports provides a clean, sandboxed environment to view your favorite sports schedules. We keep the final results hidden as private variables until you're ready to execute the peek command.

This project is built for the modern, tech-savvy sports fan who records games or watches on-demand and demands a spoiler-free experience.
